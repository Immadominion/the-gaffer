/**
 * Privy auth — the production identity layer. Verifies the user's Privy access
 * token (local JWT verification, no per-request network), then resolves them to
 * a server-authoritative **Sui** embedded wallet.
 *
 * Sui is a Privy "Tier 2" chain, so we create the wallet explicitly with
 * chain_type 'sui' (never a Solana/EVM default) and key it to the user via a
 * deterministic external_id + idempotency_key — so "get or create" is one safe,
 * repeatable call. That address is the player identity the rest of the system
 * already speaks in. (The frontend should treat this as the user's wallet — i.e.
 * fund *this* address — so there's exactly one wallet per player.)
